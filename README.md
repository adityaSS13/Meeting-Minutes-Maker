# Meeting-Minutes-Maker  
(From Ed Donner's Udemy course)
A tool that creates meeting minutes and action items from audio using both open- and closed-source LLMs.  
For converting audio to text (transcribing audio), OpenAI's open source Speech Recognition model 'Whisper' has been used. Also, the use of closed source 'gpt-4o-mini-transcribe' model has been shown (OpenAI API key needs to be purchased and included in the .env file, or added to Google Colab's 'secrets' field)
